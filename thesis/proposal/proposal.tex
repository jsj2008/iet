\section{Introduction}
This project will involve assessing the suitability of WebGL for procedural generation of realistic indoor enviroments. 
In doing so, a comparison will be made with non-procedural techniques for creating indoor scenes.
The comparison will take into account several metrics such as performance, presentability of finished product and ease of constructing the scene.
Techniques for directing the output of procedural techniques will also be done, and how they can be harnessed to create realistic environments.
